# todoman_websocket_view

Async web view of tasks VTODO from todoman by using socketio.ASGIApp: https://github.com/lucaswiman/python-socketio/blob/main/examples/server/asgi/app.py

I am using this to instantly view my tasks on tablet in kiosk mode by using WallPanel (https://wallpanel.xyz/docs/getting-started) android app.
